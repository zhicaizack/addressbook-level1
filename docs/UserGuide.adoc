[[StartingTheProgram]]
== Starting the program

*Using IntelliJ*

. Find the project in the `Project Explorer` (usually located at the left side)
.. If the `Project Explorer` is not visible, press ALT+1 for Windows/Linux, CMD+1 for macOS to open the `Project Explorer` tab
. Go to the `src` folder and locate the `AddressBook` file
. Right click the file and select `Run AddressBook.main()`
. The program now should run on the `Console` (usually located at the bottom side)
. Now you can interact with the program through the `Console`

*Using Command Line*

. 'Build' the project using IntelliJ (`Build` -> `Build Project`)
. Open the `Terminal`/`Command Prompt`. Note: You can open a terminal inside Intellij too (`View` -> `Tool Windows` -> `Terminal`)
. `cd` into the project's `out\production\addressbook-level1` directory. Note: That is the where Intellij puts its compiled class files
. Type `java seedu.addressbook.AddressBook`, then Enter to execute
. Now you can interact with the program through the CLI

=== Saving the data

Address book data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data.

There is no need to save manually.

=== Changing the save location

Address book data are saved in a file called `addressbook.txt` in the project root folder.
You can change the location by specifying the file path as a program argument.

Example:

* `java seedu.addressbook.AddressBook mydata.txt`
* `java seedu.addressbook.AddressBook myFolder/mydata.txt`

[NOTE]
====
The file path must contain a valid file name and a valid parent directory. +
File name is valid if it has an extension and no reserved characters (OS-dependent). +
Parent directory is valid if it exists. +
Note for non-Windows users: if the file already exists, it must be a 'regular' file.

[NOTE]
====
When running the program inside IntelliJ, there is a way to set command line parameters
before running the program.
